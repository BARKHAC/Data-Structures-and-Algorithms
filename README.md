I. TwoSum
1. Created a bruteforce method to solve classic TwoSum, where given an array and a target there exist two numbers in the array whose sum is target.
2. Created a more optimized HashMap based approach, where we iterate over array just once, check if target - current value exists in HMap, if not store value in Hmap.
